Let me preface this by saying that my friends and I were all pretty big nerds 🤓 - like we were on the robotics team at our high school. 😬 Aside from that embarrassing fact, the point is that we got invited to a party for the first time and we were all way to excited. Girls 💃 were gonna be there, and weed 🌿, and alcohol 🍺, I mean sweet! We were gonna get fucked up for the first time and it was gonna be AWESOME! 🤯🤪😵🥴🤢🤮 Welp, alright. So maybe it wasn't that great, but it definitely felt good to be drunk."},{text:"That was my first time drinking and my first time getting high, and by the time senior year rolled around I was drunk 🥴 or high 😵 just about everyday. I thought it was cool 😎 to be fucked up 24\u002F7, but for some reason my friends didn't seem to think so. 🤔😕 After almost failing a couple of my classes, retaking a crap ton of tests 📝 and the world's most awkward intervention, ಥ_ಥ I finally got done with my senior year of high school. 🥳🎊🎉🎈"},{text:"I really did NOT ❌ want to go to college, but it was either that or stay with my parents for even more of my life 💀, so it seemed like a pretty easy decision to make. Before moving up to UC Santa Cruz I figured that I should get ready for college, so I got a buzz cut 💇‍♂️, died my hair blonde 👱‍♂️, gave myself a tattoo 🧷, and pierced my ears 👂... Greeeeaaaaattttt 🙄🙄 idea. I looked SUPER cool.

From that point on, it basically became my mission to try 🍴 all of this stuff out. I mean for an eighteen 🔞 year old kid that loved 😍 drugs more than anything, this was essentially my dream 😴💭🦄 come true."},{text:"Here's the only bad news - drugs 💊 are WAY too expensive (especially for a broke 😢 college student).
