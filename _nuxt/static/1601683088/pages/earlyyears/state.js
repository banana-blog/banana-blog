Okay no, I'm just kidding - it's me Collin. I'm the guy that made that Banana Plug app 🍌 where people could buy drugs at UC Santa Cruz.

I grew up and was raised there, right in the heart of Silicon Valley. In fact, my house was only about a few blocks away from the infamous Apple 'donut' building (see below). As long as I can remember, I had always been interested in computers and so had my brother (which made sense seeing as how our dad had worked in the tech industry for years and so had our grandpa). This meant that I was always thinking of projects or games that I wanted to work on, regardless of the fact that these thoughts rarely if ever led anywhere."},{text:"I will say that I honestly don't recall all that much growing up and so it's hard for me to give exact details. That being said, I do remember in elementary school that I often found myself getting sent to the principles office for distracting others or talking over the teacher. Unfortunatelty this pattern continued into middle school, while my parent's were always congratulaing my older brother on getting straight A's and always being placed into more advanced classes."},{text:"I did my best to follow in my brother's footsteps of excelling - specifically in mathmatics and the sciences (although I wasn't all that excited or very good at either one of them). I was still always getting in trouble at school for talking or making some joke that the teachers never found very funny (turns out that teachers are very tough critics).
